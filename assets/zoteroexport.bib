	abstract = {NMEA 0183 is a combined electrical and data specification for communication between marine electronics such as echo sounder, sonars, anemometer, gyrocompass, autopilot, GPS receivers and many other types of instruments. It has been defined and is controlled by the National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA). It replaces the earlier NMEA 0180 and NMEA 0182 standards. In leisure marine applications it is slowly being phased out in favor of the newer NMEA 2000 standard, though NMEA0183 remains the norm in commercial shipping. 
The electrical standard that is used is EIA-422, although most hardware with NMEA-0183 outputs are also able to drive a single EIA-232 port. Although the standard calls for isolated inputs and outputs, there are various series of hardware that do not adhere to this requirement.
The NMEA 0183 standard uses a simple ASCII, serial communications protocol that defines how data are transmitted in a "sentence" from one "talker" to multiple "listeners" at a time.  Through the use of intermediate expanders, a talker can have a unidirectional conversation with a nearly unlimited number of listeners, and using multiplexers, multiple sensors can talk to a single computer port.
At the application layer, the standard also defines the contents of each sentence (message) type, so that all listeners can parse messages accurately.
While NMEA0183 only defines an RS422 transport, there also exists a de facto standard in which the sentences from NMEA0183 are placed in UDP datagrams (one sentence per packet) and sent over an IP network.
The NMEA standard is proprietary and sells for at least US\$2000 (except for members of the NMEA) as of September 2020. However, much of it has been reverse-engineered from public sources.},

Implementation was carried out over a hardware experimental setup developed. The system comprised of three NodeMCU ESP-32 boards connected in a mesh network topology. Here the data were acquired from two different sensors interfaced to two NodeMCU ESP-32 boards. The purpose was to transfer this acquired data collectively to a third NodeMCU ESP-32 board without subscribing to any internet and without deploying any router in between them. There was no parent node as here each node was talking to every other node in the network as long as a valid route was available. The experimental results proved that the system connected in a mesh network topology has an inherent characteristic to establish communication between each node automatically and would be able to self-heal in case any route becomes disabled.},

	abstract = {Existing WiFi mesh networks are usually implemented on high-end or PC grade platforms. However, the open source community has been recently developing a unique mesh network library targeted for the low-cost and resource limited ESP8266 platform. The so called painlessMesh library enables two or more ESP8266 modules to self-configure and to form a WiFi mesh network. This might open up new potential for the ESP8266 to be used in wider application areas. The library is in an early development stage and not much is known about its performance. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate to what extent the ESP8266 painlessMesh network can perform, in terms of one-way delay and data rate. Measurements showed that a 2-node network has a delay of 2.49 ms. A network consisting of higher number of nodes tends to have an increased network delay even for the same hop distance. Meanwhile, data rate measurements showed that for the case of 10-byte payload a node can receive up to 461 messages/sec. Whereas for payload of 4400 bytes, the node can receive up to 28 messages/sec. Furthermore, it can be reported that payload greater than 4400 bytes starts causing incomplete and erroneous messages.},

We consider the use of special high mobility nodes, here called “messengers”, to improve the connectivity of such networks. The proposed application was implemented and built over a mesh network. A mobile messenger was implemented and deployed on a drone to achieve local connectivity in the network. A security layer was proposed to provide authentication and non-repudiation services, which are essential in remote sensing applications where the integrity of the sensing information is critical. Our results prove the viability of the proposed approach and show that the use of precisely planned mobile messenger routes can significantly improve network communication parameters.},

This approach is however incapable of considering real-life noise, radio propagation models, channel bit error rate and signal-to-noise ratio. Most importantly, existing frameworks or simulation software cannot sense physical-layer related information regarding power consumption which an increasing number of routing protocols utilize as a metric. The work presented in this paper contributes to the analysis of already existing routing scheme evaluation frameworks and testbeds and proposes an efficient, universal and standardized hardware testbed.

Khususnya, jika robot yang disebar merupakan robot otonom untuk meningkatkan proses pencarian, secara efektif dan efisien. Pada artikel ini, kami mengusulkan sebuah robot otonom untuk pencarian korban bencana yang ditanamkan metode waypoint dengan mengeksploitasi sensor, GPS dan divais komunikasi. Hasil yang didapat menunjukkan bahwa robot ini mampu mencari korban bencana secara otonom dengan mendeteksi pergerakan kecil dan temperatur korban. Kemudian, koordinat lokasi korban dikirim ke tim SAR untuk operasi penyelamatan. Robot ini juga mampu melakukan perjalanan pulang ke posko asal untuk pengisian daya ketika daya baterainya hampir habis.

ABSTRACT

In the case of disaster, the deployment of robots is immensely helpful for SAR team in the process of searching the victims. Especially, if the deployed robots are autonomous to enhance the searching process, effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we propose an autonomous robot for searching the disaster victims embedded by automatic waypoint method by exploiting sensors, GPS and communication devices. Result shows that this robot is able to search the victims autonomously by detecting their slight movement and temperature then sending the coordinates to the SAR team for the rescue operation. This robot is also able to do the return trip autonomously to the initial post for charging when its power is almost running out.

	abstract = {In recent years, FANET-related research and development has doubled, due to the increased demands of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in both military and civilian operations. Equipped with more capabilities and unique characteristics, FANET is able to play a vital role in mission-critical applications. However, these distinctive features enforce a series of guidelines to be considered for its efficient deployment. Particularly, the use of FANET for on-time data communication services presents demanding challenges in terms of energy efficiency and quality of service (QoS). Proper use of communication architecture and wireless technology will assist to solve these challenges. Therefore, in this paper, we review different communication architectures, including the existing wireless technologies, in order to provide seamless wireless connectivity. Based on the discussions, we conclude that a multi-layer UAV ad-hoc network is the most suitable architecture for networking a group of heterogeneous UAVs, while Bluetooth 5 (802.15.1) is the most favored option because of its low-cost, low power consumption, and longer transmission range for FANET. However, 802.15.1 has the limitation of a lower data rate as compared to Wi-Fi (802.11). Therefore, we propose a hybrid wireless communication scheme so as to utilize the features of the high data transmission rate of 802.11 and the low-power consumption of 802.15.1. The proposed scheme significantly reduces communication cost and improves the network performance in terms of throughput and delay. Further, simulation results using the Optimized Network Engineering Tool (OPNET) further support the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.},

The research findings show that the occurrence of Coronavirus in China has significant impacts all across the globe. Due to this virus threat, outside people fear to mix up with the Chinese population. The global tourists have canceled their programs to visit China and the Chinese tourists are banned to visit overseas nations. The rapid spread of the Corona virus in China has stopped the normal life of the people in China. This fear has impacted the tourism industry of the country domestically and internationally. The airlines have canceled all flights in recent times from and to China so that the virus is not carried to other countries. This has affected the economy of the country to a large extent.

This study aims to present the reactions of travelers during the pandemic trends outlined by adopting text mining techniques. Between December 30, 2019–March 15, 2020, approximately 75,000 comments are retrieved from the TripAdvisor forums, and 23,515 cases from the US, Europe, and Asia forums are employed for analyses. The results reveal that the tourism sector is easily affected by global crises. It is almost the same day that travelers decide to cancel or delay their trips, with the spread of the news. More in-depth analyses uncovered several topics consisted of comments on benefiting from travel insurance and refund due to the travel cancellations. Travel insurance has become a hot topic, which may be a way of reanimating the industry by offering travel packages, including travel insurance services.},

In this article, fire investigations from 144 unintentional fatal residential fires have been systematically analyzed and technical measures that would have been effective in preventing each fatality have been identified. The result shows that, generally, a thermally activated suppression system (e.g. sprinkler) has the highest potential effectiveness (68\%) followed by a detector-activated system in bedroom and living room (59\%) or smoke alarm (37\%). For smokers with home care, however, the potential effectiveness of a thermally activated suppression system and home smoke alarm was significantly lower (31\% and 14\%, respectively). This indicates that different measures are effective for different groups. In one-fifth of the cases, the victim could have evacuated but chose not to do so, primarily to attempt to extinguish the fire.},

In the past two decades significant technologic advances have resulted in the development of inexpensive and reliable smoke detectors. These detectors can provide early warning to allow sleeping residents easy exist when a fire ocfurs in the house. Currently, there are three major types of early warning devices: heat detectors, photoelectric smoke detectors, and ionization smoke detectors. Heat detectors sound an alarm in response to rapid increases in temperature and/or ambient temperatures above 135 F. Photoelectric smoke detectors are particularly effective for smoldering fires, because they are less influenced by the smaller particles of combustion emitted during household cooking or from automobile exhaust than are ionization smoke detectors. The ionization smoke detectors respond more quickly than photoelectric smoke detectors to fast burning fires and have been proved effective in sounding an early alarm in the vast majority of home fires. For best all-around fire protection, a home should have more than one type of detector. Detectors should be located on the ceiling or high on the ceiling of every level of the house close to each bedroom. Properly installed and maintained smoke detectors can reduce the tragic consequences of home fires, but even greater gains can be made by combining these early warning systems with a reduction in home fire hazards and in practicing a well planned fire escape route.},

The book is suited for students at the college senior and first-year graduate level with prior background in mathematical analysis, vectors, matrices, probability, statistics, linear systems, and computer programming. As in all earlier editions, the focus of this edition of the book is on fundamentals. The 4th Edition, which celebrates the book's 40th anniversary, is based on an extensive survey of faculty, students, and independent readers in 150 institutions from 30 countries. Their feedback led to expanded or new coverage of topics such as deep learning and deep neural networks, including convolutional neural nets, the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), maximally-stable extremal regions (MSERs), graph cuts, k-means clustering and superpixels, active contours (snakes and level sets), and exact histogram matching. Major improvements were made in reorganizing the material on image transforms into a more cohesive presentation, and in the discussion of spatial kernels and spatial filtering. Major revisions and additions were made to examples and homework exercises throughout the book. For the first time, we added MATLAB projects at the end of every chapter, and compiled support packages for you and your teacher containing, solutions, image databases, and sample code."--Amazon.com.},

Sehingga untuk kebutuhan  kebutuhan pengukuran yang khusus sesuai dengan yang diinginkan perlu di kembangkan sendiri. Sistem alat ukur seperti ini biasa disebut dengan model sistem akuisisi data. Sistim akuisisi data dapat didefinisikan sebagai suatu sistem yang berfungsi untuk mengambil, mengumpulkan dan menyiapkan data, hingga memprosesnya untuk menghasilkan data yang dikehendaki. Pengembangan system akuisisi data ini biasanya melibatkan dua sub system yaitu sub system hardware sebagai pengambil data dari obyek yang diukur dan sub system software yang merupakan sub system untuk mengumplkan dan memproses data yang kemudian dapat ditampilkan sesuai dengan kebutuhan. Berdasar latar belakang, dapat dijelaskan bahwa lemahnya pengukuran data pada proses desain dan pengujian kolektor surya perlu ditindaklanjuti melalui metode-metode pengukuran yang memanfaatkan teknologi akuisisi data dan teknologi monitoring jarak jauh (telemetri). Pada penelitian ini akan didesain alat ukur dengan menggunakan sistem akuisisi data untuk monitoring suhu berbasis telemetri. Pada penelitian ini pengujian system akuisisi data dilakukan untuk mengukur suhu ruangan yang dilakukan selama 2 jam, dengan sample data yang diambil yaitu 1 data setiap 10 detik secara otoatis dan real time dengan menggunakan sensor suhu jenis LM35. Dalam waktu 2 jam data yang terkumpul sejumlah 720 data suhu ruangan. memperlihatkan hasil pengukuran. Dari hasil pengukuran didapatkan bahwa selama 1 jam suhu disekitar ruangan tidak mengalami perubahan yang signifikan, dengan diperlihatkan pada suhu 30 derajat Celcius secara konstan. Karena belum terdapat perubahan yang signifikan maka sensor dicoba untuk di dekati dengan pemanas untuk menguji sensifitasnya. Dari hasil perlakuan didapatkan bahwa sensor dapat mendeteksi perubahan suhu disekitarnya. Sistem telemetri yang dikembangkan menggunakan sepasang antenna radio jenis YS1020UB. Antenna radio ini dapat melakukan komunikasi secara dua arah atau yang lebih dikenal dengan istilah TRANSCEIVER. Pada percobaan yang dilakukan data yang dapat diterima secara maksimal berada pada jarak 100 m, untuk jarak lebih dari 100 meter terdapat error-error pembacaan. Dari hasil analisis ketidak maksimalan jarak jangkau pengiriman data dari modul transiter ke modul receiver berikut dibaca pada computer dikarenakan factor delay yang terjadi pada saat pengiriman karena lokasi uji coba tidak berada pada daerah line of sight, factor lain yang mempegaruhi karena error data karena delay yang terjadi ketika proses transferring data melalui port USB kemudian ditampilkan pada software.},

	abstract = {This chapter presents methods and techniques to design time-varying linear systems such as filters with precise time-frequency (t,f) specifications; this capability can then allow one to model and predict accurately the effects of linear systems on nonstationary signals in applications such as signal cleansing and enhancement. This topic is covered in six sections. The design of time-varying filters is required in applications where it is desired to separate, suppress, or reduce undesirable nonstationary signal components. This can be performed with piece-wise harmonic decomposition methods such as the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and the Gabor transform (Section 11.1). In particular, the use of the Gabor expansion for time-varying filtering is illustrated on an application that involves monitoring machine vibrations; in addition, an alternative method, the inverse STFT is applied to (t,f) filtering with an illustration on a speech signal (Section 11.2). Another illustration of the procedure for designing a time-varying filter is provided in the context of an application involving handsfree telephone speech signals (Section 11.3). Another important application of time-varying filtering procedure, namely signal enhancement, is described using an iterative algorithm based on time-frequency peak filtering (Section 11.4). Then, a method for subspace noise filtering using a time-frequency distribution is described (Section 11.5); and finally a comparison of denoising algorithms for speech enhancement completes the chapter (Section 11.6).},

	abstract = {The Mediterranean region accounts the larger proportion of human caused fires in the world (95\%) followed by South Asia (90\%), South America (85\%) and Northeast Asia (80\%) (FAO 2007). Socio-economic changes which are occurring in Europe along with global warming result in an augment of fire risk. Systematic and reliable information on fire causes is necessary in order to improve wildland fire management. However, collection of information on forest fire causes and motivations is still quite restricted in most countries around the world. The unknown cause is still too frequent in many wildfire statistics. A promising technique to overcome this shortcoming is the Delphi technique which uses a panel of carefully selected experts to improve the knowledge on fire motivations in a specific area. Understanding more about why people start fires would help to reduce the impacts of deliberate fire lighting. Spatial and temporal analysis of wildland fire occurrence data and the interaction with explanatory geographical variables is a critical part of fire management activities. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are appropriate tools to create, transform, combine and integrate variables related to fire risk in order to find geographical and analytical relationships which help to discriminate areas where risk factors are most severe in order to adopt the appropriate preventive actions},

	abstract = {An electroacoustic transducer is a device that converts acoustic energy (sound) into electrical energy (voltage or current) or vice versa. When the transducer is used to generate sound, it is called a projector, transmitter, or source. When it is used to detect sound, it is called a receiver. Furthermore, when the receiver is employed underwater, it is referred to as a hydrophone. An underwater sonar system consists of projectors, hydrophones, and associated electronics such as amplifiers and data acquisition systems. This chapter, however, will only cover the description and operational principles of the projector and hydrophone components. More specifically, the chapter will focus on piezoelectric ceramic-based transducer designs intended for underwater use that operate in the frequency band spanning from 1 kHz to 1MHz. This span covers weapons sonar (1–100kHz) and imaging sonar (100kHz to 1MHz) applications.},

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have revolutionized the aircraft industry in this decade. UAVs are now capable of carrying out remote sensing, remote monitoring, courier delivery, and a lot more. A lot of research is happening on making UAVs more robust using energy harvesting techniques to have a better battery lifetime, network performance and to secure against attackers. UAV networks are many times used for unmanned missions. There have been many attacks on civilian, military, and industrial targets that were carried out using remotely controlled or automated UAVs. This continued misuse has led to research in preventing unauthorized UAVs from causing damage to life and property. In this paper, we present a literature review of UAVs, UAV attacks, and their prevention using anti-UAV techniques. We first discuss the different types of UAVs, the regulatory laws for UAV activities, their use cases, recreational, and military UAV incidents. After understanding their operation, various techniques for monitoring and preventing UAV attacks are described along with case studies.},
