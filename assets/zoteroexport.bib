	abstract = {NMEA 0183 is a combined electrical and data specification for communication between marine electronics such as echo sounder, sonars, anemometer, gyrocompass, autopilot, GPS receivers and many other types of instruments. It has been defined and is controlled by the National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA). It replaces the earlier NMEA 0180 and NMEA 0182 standards. In leisure marine applications it is slowly being phased out in favor of the newer NMEA 2000 standard, though NMEA0183 remains the norm in commercial shipping. 
The electrical standard that is used is EIA-422, although most hardware with NMEA-0183 outputs are also able to drive a single EIA-232 port. Although the standard calls for isolated inputs and outputs, there are various series of hardware that do not adhere to this requirement.
The NMEA 0183 standard uses a simple ASCII, serial communications protocol that defines how data are transmitted in a "sentence" from one "talker" to multiple "listeners" at a time.  Through the use of intermediate expanders, a talker can have a unidirectional conversation with a nearly unlimited number of listeners, and using multiplexers, multiple sensors can talk to a single computer port.
At the application layer, the standard also defines the contents of each sentence (message) type, so that all listeners can parse messages accurately.
While NMEA0183 only defines an RS422 transport, there also exists a de facto standard in which the sentences from NMEA0183 are placed in UDP datagrams (one sentence per packet) and sent over an IP network.
The NMEA standard is proprietary and sells for at least US\$2000 (except for members of the NMEA) as of September 2020. However, much of it has been reverse-engineered from public sources.},

The wireless sensor node is made by integrating a dust sensor based on GP2Y1010AU0F chip, a STM32F103ZET6 chip as its MCU, a Wi-Fi module as its wireless transceiver, and a LCD screen as its user-interface. The dust sensor takes the light scattering method, measuring the flash frequency and the duration reflected by particles in the air flow. Dust sensor nodes are networking by Wi-Fi mesh network. Practical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The measuring error of dust concentration is less than 5\%. As the network is made up of 8-10 nodes, if the root node is disconnected, the network recovery time is less than 9 seconds while the other nodes’ is less than 5 seconds.},

Here the data were acquired from two different sensors interfaced to two NodeMCU ESP-32 boards. The purpose was to transfer this acquired data collectively to a third NodeMCU ESP-32 board without subscribing to any internet and without deploying any router in between them. There was no parent node as here each node was talking to every other node in the network as long as a valid route was available. The experimental results proved that the system connected in a mesh network topology has an inherent characteristic to establish communication between each node automatically and would be able to self-heal in case any route becomes disabled.},

	abstract = {Existing WiFi mesh networks are usually implemented on high-end or PC grade platforms. However, the open source community has been recently developing a unique mesh network library targeted for the low-cost and resource limited ESP8266 platform. The so called painlessMesh library enables two or more ESP8266 modules to self-configure and to form a WiFi mesh network. This might open up new potential for the ESP8266 to be used in wider application areas. The library is in an early development stage and not much is known about its performance. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate to what extent the ESP8266 painlessMesh network can perform, in terms of one-way delay and data rate. Measurements showed that a 2-node network has a delay of 2.49 ms. A network consisting of higher number of nodes tends to have an increased network delay even for the same hop distance. Meanwhile, data rate measurements showed that for the case of 10-byte payload a node can receive up to 461 messages/sec. Whereas for payload of 4400 bytes, the node can receive up to 28 messages/sec. Furthermore, it can be reported that payload greater than 4400 bytes starts causing incomplete and erroneous messages.},

We consider the use of special high mobility nodes, here called “messengers”, to improve the connectivity of such networks. The proposed application was implemented and built over a mesh network. A mobile messenger was implemented and deployed on a drone to achieve local connectivity in the network. A security layer was proposed to provide authentication and non-repudiation services, which are essential in remote sensing applications where the integrity of the sensing information is critical. Our results prove the viability of the proposed approach and show that the use of precisely planned mobile messenger routes can significantly improve network communication parameters.},

Pada kasus bencana alam, penyebaran robot pada area bencana sangat bermanfaat bagi tim SAR dalam proses pencarian korban. Khususnya, jika robot yang disebar merupakan robot otonom untuk meningkatkan proses pencarian, secara efektif dan efisien. Pada artikel ini, kami mengusulkan sebuah robot otonom untuk pencarian korban bencana yang ditanamkan metode waypoint dengan mengeksploitasi sensor, GPS dan divais komunikasi. Hasil yang didapat menunjukkan bahwa robot ini mampu mencari korban bencana secara otonom dengan mendeteksi pergerakan kecil dan temperatur korban. Kemudian, koordinat lokasi korban dikirim ke tim SAR untuk operasi penyelamatan. Robot ini juga mampu melakukan perjalanan pulang ke posko asal untuk pengisian daya ketika daya baterainya hampir habis.

ABSTRACT

In the case of disaster, the deployment of robots is immensely helpful for SAR team in the process of searching the victims. Especially, if the deployed robots are autonomous to enhance the searching process, effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we propose an autonomous robot for searching the disaster victims embedded by automatic waypoint method by exploiting sensors, GPS and communication devices. Result shows that this robot is able to search the victims autonomously by detecting their slight movement and temperature then sending the coordinates to the SAR team for the rescue operation. This robot is also able to do the return trip autonomously to the initial post for charging when its power is almost running out.

A UAV connects with other UAVs through WIFI and performs needed actions based on the circumstances. A UAV collects data in the form of images or videos, sends the data to the base station or the master UAV for backup, analyses the data, recognizes the object, tracks the location of the objects, follows the instruction and shares the data with other UAVs with the help of computers, microprocessors, microcontrollers and WIFI microchips. UAVs can be controlled remotely within a range of 100 meters. Here we are implementing the MASTER-SLAVE architecture with the UAVs. We used RASPBERRY PI in the master UAV and ARDUINO UNO in the slave UAVs.},

	abstract = {In recent years, FANET-related research and development has doubled, due to the increased demands of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in both military and civilian operations. Equipped with more capabilities and unique characteristics, FANET is able to play a vital role in mission-critical applications. However, these distinctive features enforce a series of guidelines to be considered for its efficient deployment. Particularly, the use of FANET for on-time data communication services presents demanding challenges in terms of energy efficiency and quality of service (QoS). Proper use of communication architecture and wireless technology will assist to solve these challenges. Therefore, in this paper, we review different communication architectures, including the existing wireless technologies, in order to provide seamless wireless connectivity. Based on the discussions, we conclude that a multi-layer UAV ad-hoc network is the most suitable architecture for networking a group of heterogeneous UAVs, while Bluetooth 5 (802.15.1) is the most favored option because of its low-cost, low power consumption, and longer transmission range for FANET. However, 802.15.1 has the limitation of a lower data rate as compared to Wi-Fi (802.11). Therefore, we propose a hybrid wireless communication scheme so as to utilize the features of the high data transmission rate of 802.11 and the low-power consumption of 802.15.1. The proposed scheme significantly reduces communication cost and improves the network performance in terms of throughput and delay. Further, simulation results using the Optimized Network Engineering Tool (OPNET) further support the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.},

	abstract = {Ensuring the desired level of security is an important issue in all communicating systems, and it becomes more challenging in wireless environments. Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) are an emerging type of mobile network that is built using energy-restricted devices. Hence, the communications interface used and that computation complexity are additional factors to consider when designing secure protocols for these networks. In the literature, various solutions have been proposed to ensure secure and reliable internode communications, and these FANET nodes are known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In general, these UAVs are often detected as malicious due to an unintentional misbehavior related to the physical features of the UAVs, the communication mediums, or the network interface. In this paper, we propose a new context-aware trust-based solution to distinguish between intentional and unintentional UAV misbehavior. The main goal is to minimize the generated error ratio while meeting the desired security levels. Our proposal simultaneously establishes the inter-UAV trust and estimates the current context in terms of UAV energy, mobility pattern, and enqueued packets, in order to ensure full context awareness in the overall honesty evaluation. In addition, based on computed trust and context metrics, we also propose a new inter-UAV packet delivery strategy. Simulations conducted using NS2.35 evidence the efficiency of our proposal, called , at ensuring high detection ratios {\textgreater} 87\% and high accuracy with reduced end-to-end delay, clearly outperforming previous proposals known as , -, and .},
